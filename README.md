A Flip Card Quiz For Studying For JavaScript Certification

This is a basic flip card quiz for studying JavaScript certification. Questions will be based on W3School exercises. 
I created this project while attending Generation USA Jr. Web Developer boot camp. I hoped that creating my own javascript project would help me learn the language better.

The JavaScript is very simple. Just some functions that allow specific classes to appear when they need to appear. 
Styling is done with CSS.
